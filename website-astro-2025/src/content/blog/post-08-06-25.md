So every now and then i think about a video from xiph.org posted on the FL Studio youtube page.
When i watched it as an anudio engineering student back in 2015 it cemeneted a few things that I'd heard about but not really understood thus far.

Neil Young (yes that Neil Young) had recently launched the Pono, a "high resolution "digital music player, similar to an ipod with the special sauce of being able to play back at extremely high sample rates. The marketing video gave me the heebejeebees. References to vibes and metafors seemed like a load of old cobblers, but i really had nothign to back it up.
